# FLIGHT ANALYTICS DASHBOARD 
This simple dashboard combines various visualisation and data analytics tool to display a user friendly dashboard for historical flights and give the users some useful insights

## User Interface (UI)

At the heart of the Flight Dashboard Project lies a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies aviation data visualization and interaction. The UI provides real-time information, navigation tools, and communication systems, making it accessible to all users.

## DATA INTEGRATION 
The project integrates with various HISTORICAL data sources, including aviation databases, weather services, and real-time flight data providers.
The dataset being too large to upload on github, below is glimpse of datasets used for this project

## Making prediction
various machine learning algorithms are used to provide the flight delay prediction in the website.

## Real time monitoring 
Real-time data streaming and monitoring are key components of the project, allowing users to track the status of flights, weather conditions, and navigation parameters.using fastAPI i have tried to integrate real time monitoring in this dashboard.
